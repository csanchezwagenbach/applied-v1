## Installation
To simulate the development environment, users will first need to download Node.js onto their machines.  A full guide detailing the installation of Node may be found [here.](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs) Additionally, prospective developers must configure their own machines to host a MongoDB database. A full guide detailing such configurations may be found [here.](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb)

## Usage
Users create an account by providing a username, password, and unique email address. Upon creating an account, users are directed to their dashboard where previously created applications will be displayed (New users will see an empty dashboard awaiting population). Clicking "Create App" in the NavBar sends users to a form where they may input information about a given job application and upload materials pertaining to that application (i.e. a resume, cover letter). Upon saving the application, a user is directed to a preview of the application in question printing all its information in full. A user may navigate to this preview from their dashboard by clicking on the "View" button below each of the saved application cards. On this preview page, a user is given the option to update their application. Clicking this option will take users to a form with saved application data populating input areas. Users may edit this form, and upon submitting the form, the application will be updated with all entered data, and the user is redirected to the preview of the updated application.
